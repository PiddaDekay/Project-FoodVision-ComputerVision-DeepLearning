# Project-Computer-Vision-DeepLearning
# We are going to do:

1. Using TensorFlow Datasets to download and explore data
2. Creating preprocessing function for our data
3. Batching & preparing datasets for modelling (making our datasets run fast)
4. Creating modelling callbacks
5. Setting up mixed precision training
6. Building a feature extraction model (see transfer learning part 1: feature extraction)
7. Fine-tuning the feature extraction model (see transfer learning part 2: fine-tuning)
8. Viewing training results on TensorBoard
